Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: It helps us with version control, so we can revert to previous versions of our codebase if needed. It also 
acts as another way to store our codebase, so we can always delete or reset our local repository if needed. It also 
allows us to effective share code and have multiple people work on the same remote repository.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to epidemiology. For example, data scientists can analyze COVID-19 
case data to identify which regions had the highest infection rates, track how the disease spread over time, 
and help inform public health responses.


Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging combines two branches by creating a merge commit that preserves the history of both branches, 
resulting in a non-linear commit graph showing parallel development. Rebasing rewrites a branch by replaying 
its commits on top of another branch’s latest commit, producing a linear history. Unlike merging, rebasing 
does not preserve the original branch structure.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I'm looking foward to getting to learn about a new area of computer science and I am also excited for 
the many plans that I have with friends this semester.
