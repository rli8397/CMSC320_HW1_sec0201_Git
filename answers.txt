Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: It helps us with version control, so we can revert to previous versions of our codebase if needed. It also 
acts as another way to store our codebase, so we can always delete or reset our local repository if needed. It also 
allows us to effective share code and have multiple people work on the same remote repository.
